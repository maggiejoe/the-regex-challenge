# The Regex Challenge

Introductory paragraph (replace this with your text)

## Summary

In this challenge I will explain how the following Regex is used to match Hex Values. 

/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

If you aren't familiary with Hex Values, they are values used to display specific color(s). It is broken down into three sets of 1-3 digits per set. For example, the following Hex Values describe the color green 

(0, 128, 0)

As you go through this gist, you'll learn how the Regex expression above works to find any Hex Values.
